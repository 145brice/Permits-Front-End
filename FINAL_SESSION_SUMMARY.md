## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

### What Worked:
1. **CSV Downloads** - San Antonio, Phoenix both working via CSV
2. **CKAN APIs** - Boston working great with datastore API
3. **Socrata APIs** - Austin, Chicago, Seattle, Chattanooga all solid
4. **Parallel Testing** - Tested multiple cities simultaneously

### What Didn't Work:
1. **ArcGIS REST APIs** - Hit or miss (Atlanta failed, others blocked)
2. **Form-based Portals** - Houston, Charlotte require scraping
3. **Power BI Reports** - Charlotte/Mecklenburg too complex
4. **Deprecated APIs** - Nashville moved platforms

### Recommendations:
1. **Launch with 7 cities** - It's enough for revenue
2. **Fix cities based on customer demand** - Let revenue guide you
3. **Milwaukee is easy fix** - Just need to handle CSV format
4. **Don't spend time** on cities without APIs - focus on revenue
